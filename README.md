### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Allen.  
- I am currently working in Shanghai.  
- My current focus is on maintaining and refactoring some of the company's existing projects, because it has limitations as the business has grown, and I find that very interesting and challenging.  
- I am also trying some front-end engineering related construction, hoping to help the team develop more healthily and bring some technical precipitation.  
- In my spare time, I am also interested in learning some techniques that I have not mastered. Recently, I am learning TS, and I have a plan to read some algorithm problems and add some basic JS knowledge.
